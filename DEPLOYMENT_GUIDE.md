# üöÄ Beginner's Guide to Deploying Fitness Command Center on Netlify

This guide will walk you through deploying your Fitness Command Center to Netlify, including using Windsurf's built-in deployment features.

---

## üìã **Prerequisites**

Before you start, make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ Your project code ready (this Fitness Command Center)
- ‚úÖ A GitHub account
- ‚úÖ A Netlify account (free tier is perfect)
- ‚úÖ An Airtable account with your fitness database set up
- ‚úÖ Windsurf IDE (for easy deployment option)

---

## üéØ **Method 1: Deploy with Windsurf (Recommended)**

Windsurf has built-in Netlify integration that makes deployment super easy!

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Project**

1. **Open your project in Windsurf**
2. **Make sure all files are saved**
3. **Check that your `.env.local` file has the correct Airtable credentials**

### **Step 2: Use Windsurf's Netlify Deploy**

1. **Open Windsurf Command Palette**:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)

2. **Search for Netlify Deploy**:
   - Type "Netlify" and look for deployment options
   - Select "Deploy to Netlify" or "Netlify: Deploy"

3. **Follow the Windsurf Deploy Wizard**:
   - Windsurf will guide you through the deployment process
   - It may ask you to authenticate with Netlify
   - Choose your deployment settings (build command, publish directory)

### **Step 3: Configure Build Settings in Windsurf**

When prompted, use these settings:
```
Build Command: npm run build
Publish Directory: build
Functions Directory: netlify/functions
```

### **Step 4: Set Environment Variables**

After deployment, you'll need to add your environment variables:

1. **In Windsurf**, look for environment variable settings in the deploy interface
2. **Add these variables**:
   ```
   AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key_here
   AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_airtable_base_id_here
   REACT_APP_API_URL=/.netlify/functions
   ```

## üåê **Method 2: Deploy via GitHub + Netlify (Traditional)**

If Windsurf's direct deploy doesn't work, here's the traditional method:

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**

1. **Initialize Git** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Fitness Command Center"
   ```

   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "New Repository"
   - Name it: `fitness-command-center`
   - Make it Public
   - Click "Create Repository"

3. **Push Your Code**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/fitness-command-center.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### **Step 2: Connect to Netlify**

1. **Go to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com)**
2. **Sign up/Login** with your GitHub account
3. **Click "New Site from Git"**
4. **Choose GitHub** as your Git provider
5. **Select your repository**: `fitness-command-center`

### **Step 3: Configure Build Settings**

In Netlify's build settings, enter:
```
Build Command: npm run build
Publish Directory: build
Functions Directory: netlify/functions
```

### **Step 4: Deploy**

Click **"Deploy Site"** - Netlify will start building your site!
