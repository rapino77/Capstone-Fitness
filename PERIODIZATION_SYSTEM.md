# Exercise Rotation and Periodization System

## Overview

The Exercise Rotation and Periodization System is a comprehensive training optimization feature that automatically manages exercise selection and training phases to prevent plateaus, reduce injury risk, and optimize performance gains. The system implements evidence-based periodization models and intelligent exercise rotation algorithms.

## Features

### 1. Periodization Models Supported

#### Linear Periodization (LP)
- **Hypertrophy Phase**: 4 weeks, 8-15 reps, 65-80% intensity
- **Strength Phase**: 4 weeks, 3-6 reps, 80-95% intensity  
- **Power Phase**: 3 weeks, 1-3 reps, 85-100% intensity
- **Deload Phase**: 1 week, 8-12 reps, 50-65% intensity

#### Key Benefits:
- Systematic progression through training adaptations
- Automatic phase transitions based on time
- Phase-specific rep ranges and intensities
- Built-in recovery through deload weeks

### 2. Exercise Rotation System

#### Exercise Categories
- **Primary**: Main compound movements (Bench Press, Squat, Deadlift)
- **Secondary**: Supporting exercises (Dumbbell Press, Leg Press)
- **Accessory**: Isolation movements (Curls, Extensions)

#### Rotation Algorithm
The system calculates rotation scores based on:
- **Staleness**: Days since last performance (higher = more stale)
- **Overuse Penalty**: Recent frequency (prevents overuse)
- **Stagnation**: Lack of progression (encourages variety)

#### Rotation Triggers
- Score-based: When rotation score exceeds 70 points
- Time-based: Forced rotation after 8 weeks
- Stagnation-based: When no progression detected

### 3. Integration Points

#### Database Schema
New table: **Periodization**
```
Fields:
- User ID (Single line text)

- Phase Start Date (Date)
- Week in Phase (Number)
- Total Weeks in Phase (Number)
- Next Phase (Single select)
- Rotation Enabled (Checkbox)
- Auto Progression (Checkbox)

## Implementation Details

### Core Files Created

1. **`src/utils/exerciseRotation.js`**
   - Core rotation algorithms and periodization logic
   - Exercise categorization and scoring functions
   - Phase progression calculations

2. **`netlify/functions/rotation-logic.js`**
   - Server-side version of rotation logic for API endpoints
   - Node.js compatible module exports

3. **`netlify/functions/exercise-rotation.js`**
   - Main API endpoint for rotation analysis
   - Handles workout history retrieval and analysis

4. **`netlify/functions/setup-periodization-table.js`**
   - Database management for periodization tracking
   - Phase advancement and settings management

5. **`src/components/rotation/PeriodizationPanel.js`**
   - React component for UI integration
   - Displays current phase, rotation suggestions, and controls

### UI Integration

The `PeriodizationPanel` component integrates into `WorkoutForm.js` and provides:

- **Current Phase Display**: Shows active training phase and week
- **Phase-Optimized Suggestions**: Workout parameters based on current phase
- **Exercise Rotation Panel**: Alternative exercise recommendations
- **One-Click Application**: Apply suggestions directly to workout form
- **Phase Advancement**: Manual phase progression controls

### Usage in WorkoutForm

```javascript
// Added to WorkoutForm.js
{periodizationEnabled && (
  <PeriodizationPanel
    currentExercise={selectedExercise}
    onExerciseChange={handleExerciseChange}
    onPeriodizedWorkoutApply={handlePeriodizedWorkoutApply}
  />
)}
```

## Configuration

### User Controls
- **Periodization Toggle**: Enable/disable the entire system
- **Phase Advancement**: Manual control over phase transitions
- **Rotation Preferences**: Show/hide exercise alternatives

### System Settings
```javascript
// Rotation thresholds (configurable in rotation logic)
rotationThreshold: 70,        // Score threshold for rotation
forceRotationAfterWeeks: 8,   // Maximum weeks before forced rotation
maxSuggestions: 3,            // Number of alternative exercises
includeAccessoryMovements: false  // Include accessory exercises in suggestions
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Create the `Periodization` table in Airtable with the schema provided above.

### 2. Environment Variables
No additional environment variables required - uses existing Airtable credentials.

### 3. User Initialization
First time users automatically get initialized with:
- Current Phase: HYPERTROPHY
- Week in Phase: 1
- Rotation Enabled: true
- Auto Progression: true

### 4. Testing
Use the test endpoint to verify functionality:
```
GET /.netlify/functions/test-rotation-system
```

## Algorithm Details

### Rotation Score Calculation
```javascript
finalScore = staleness - overusePenalty + stagnationPenalty

Where:
- staleness = min(daysSinceLastWorkout * 2, 100)
- overusePenalty = max(0, (recentWorkouts - 4) * 15)
- stagnationPenalty = hasProgression ? 0 : 30
```

### Phase Progression
- **Linear Cycle**: Hypertrophy → Strength → Power → Deload → Hypertrophy
- **Duration**: [4, 4, 3, 1] weeks respectively
- **Auto-Advance**: Based on weeks elapsed since phase start
- **Manual Override**: Users can advance phases manually

### Exercise Selection Priority
1. **Same Category**: Prioritize exercises in same muscle group
2. **Tier Matching**: Prefer exercises of same tier (primary/secondary/accessory)
3. **Phase Optimization**: Boost scores for phase-appropriate exercises
4. **Staleness Score**: Higher scores for less recently performed exercises

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Prevents Plateaus**: Systematic exercise and intensity variation
- **Reduces Injury Risk**: Prevents overuse through rotation and deloads
