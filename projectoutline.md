## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture (Optimized for Speed & Simplicity)**

### **System Components:**

- **Frontend**: React web application (Netlify hosted)  
- **API Layer**: Netlify Functions (serverless endpoints)  
- **Database**: Airtable (no-code database with excellent API)  
- **Automation Engine**: n8n workflows (Railway/Render hosted)  
- **Notifications**: Email, SMS, Discord/Slack webhooks

### **Why Airtable for This Project:**

- **5-minute setup**: Create tables visually, get instant API  
- **Free tier**: 1,000 records (sufficient for 2-week demo)  
- **Perfect n8n integration**: Built-in Airtable nodes  
- **Visual debugging**: See all your data in a spreadsheet interface  
- **Auto-generated API docs**: No database schema wrestling

### **Data Flow:**

User Input → React App → Netlify Functions → Airtable API

                     ↓

n8n Workflows ← Airtable Webhook ← Record Changes

                     ↓

Automated Analysis → Progress Reports → User Notifications
